## **üìå Description**

**Bitrefill Gifter** is a social mini-app designed for Farcaster communities. It enables users to reward their channel members or followers with Bitrefill gift cards.

## **‚ùì Problem & Solution**

### **Problem**

Farcaster has thriving communities, but no built-in system for recognizing or rewarding meaningful engagement with tangible value. Community builders lack easy tools to incentivize participation or show appreciation to members.

### **Solution**

Bitrefill Gifter brings automated, programmable gifting into Farcaster. It connects directly to Bitrefill accounts and allows users to send gift cards (e.g., Uber, Airbnb, mobile data) to Farcaster users based on channel membership or follower status‚Äîstarting with random giveaways and expanding to more advanced reward logic, such as engagement scoring, milestone-based, etc.

## **üîÅ User Flow**

1. User enters their Bitrefill API key (once the API enables that, they will log in with their credentials via OAuth)
2. User selects a channel and defines targeting criteria (e.g., followers vs members).
3. The app fetches their Farcaster channels details and full list of followers / members using Warpcast API.
4. App randomly selects recipients based on the predefined rules.
5. App shows details of the selected user fetched from Neynar API.
6. Bitrefill API is used to issue and deliver gift cards. The balance of the connected account is used to pay for the gift card.
7. Resulting gift is posted back to the feed, optionally with a shoutout (‚Äú@frens was just gifted!‚Äù).
