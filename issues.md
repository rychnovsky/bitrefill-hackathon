Tech issues:

- CORS issues on whole API
- /accounts/balance returns "You do not have access to this API" - was fixed by Bitrefill team.
- rate limits too strict (especally on ping method)
- packages[].price - how many decimalas? Should be documented and standartized.
- missing image on the test products
- create invoice returns 500 - was fixed by Bitrefill team.
- user balance - how many decimals? Should be documented and standartized.
- product prices in EUR, but balance in BTC - how can the app check if the user has enough tokens?
- data.redemption_info wrongly typed, it is typed as string in Swagger, but API returns object

Feedback:

- no clear organization, timeline & deliverables
- no clear evaluation criteria
