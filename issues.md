Tech issues:

- CORS issues on whole API
- /accounts/balance returns "You do not have access to this API"
- rate limits too strict (especally on ping method)
- packages[].price - how many decimalas?
- missing image on the test products
- create invoice returns 500
- user balance - how many decimals?
- product prices in EUR, but balance in BTC - how can the app check if the user has enought tokens?
- data.redemption_info wrongly typed, it is typed as string, but API returns object

Feedback:

- no clear organization, timeline deliverables
- no clear evaluation criteria
